Controlls:
I nees to do this, but for the moment, you can play with the touch screen or using joystick to move, triangle to jump and circle to open ghe inventory (for better experience for the moment use the touch screen).

If you like Unity and you know how to do decomps/ports, you can help me with the code talking with me in discord: @SpanishFreddy
